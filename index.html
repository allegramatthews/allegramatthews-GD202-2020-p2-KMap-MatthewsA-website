            <div class="column"><br><br><br><br><br><br><h3><b>mental health</b></h3><body><br><br>A well-designed campus outdoor environment can have a significant impact on student mental health. On North Carolina State Universities Campus, the Court of the Carolinas functions as not only a transitional space, but one where students can sit down, rest, and enjoy their time in the sunshine, three integral parts of mental health. 

                "First time sitting in and I liked it. 
                Like, the sun was on me and usually when 
                I was walking it was kind of chilly and 
                cold in the shade, so just sitting and 
                soaking in the sun and getting that vitamin D 
                in, that’s really what it was all about.”
              </body><br><br>
              
              <h5>“Most university students 
                choose open spaces with natural settings 
                to ameliorate their moods when they are 
                stressed, upset, depressed, angry or confused.”</h5>

              <br><body>A 2015 National Collegiate health assessment 
                found that 37 percent of college students they surveyed 
                felt so depressed within the last 12 months that they 
                had difficulty functioning...It also found that 59 
                percent felt overwhelming anxiety” (Cutter 2019). 
                Given this national mental health crisis of college 
                students, college campuses need to take proactive 
                steps to mitigate stress by better leveraging existing 
                resources. Proximity to open greenspaces can greatly 
                reduce stress, especially in the lives of college 
                students, who are often under extreme pressure from 
                their academic, social, and athletic goals.</body>
                <br><br>
                <body>According to Lau, Gou, & Liu (2014), “most university 
                students choose open spaces with natural settings to 
                ameliorate their moods when they are stressed, upset, 
                depressed, angry or confused.” Therefore, outdoor space 
                design should be critically examined by not only landscape 
                architects, but by all creative and dynamic academic fields 
                across campus. By re-contextualizing outdoor multi-purpose 
                spaces as opportunities to boost student mental health, 
                professors and staff across different departments may 
                better leverage these spaces to help students manage 
                their stress.</body></div>

            <div class="column"><br><br><br><h3>physical health</h3>
            <br>
            <br>
            <body>Multi-purpose outdoor spaces often 
              incorporate natural elements to augment the  
              physical health of students on college campuses. 
              When incorporated into class curricula, greenspaces 
              help to diversify student experiences. In the article 
              Recognizing Campus Landscapes as Learning Space, 
              Scholl talks about the benefits of well-designed 
              outdoor college spaces, stating “networks of open 
              spaces on campuses can be key, yet typically 
              overlooked catalysts, in student learning.”</body>
              <br>
              <br>
              <h5>“Multi-purpose lawns in general 
                are designed for play and recreation, 
                quads are meant to gather students.”
              </h5>
              <br>
              <br>
            <body>The health effects of exposure to visual landscapes were examined with diverse approaches, such as neurosciences (blood pressure and heart rate tests), behaviors (days of recovery), perceptions (self-reported emotions and well-being), etc. The literature reveals that natural landscapes gave a stronger positive health effect compared to urban landscapes, and urban landscapes were found to have a less positive and in some cases negative effect on health.

              Because well-designed campus quads are geared towards play,  greenspaces on NCSU also inspire physical movement among students. Students in motion are physically healthier, and along with meal programs, excercise programs and the aformentioned spaces, a healthy campus lifestyle 
              is simple to achieve.  </body>
              <br>
              <br>
              <h5>“If I have an hour or two, I could throw a frisbee around.”</h5>
              <br>
              <br>
              <body>There is also a paradigm shift in the way we are thinking about parks not just on campus, but globally, that will hopefully gain traction on a larger scale. “There’s a paradigm shift in the way we think about parks: not just as a place to recreate, but literally as a prescription, a place to improve your health,” says Zarr, a doctor, who writes up to 10 park prescriptions per day.

                  By writing nature prescriptions some physicians are encouraging their patients to get outdoors and take advantage of what many view to be free medicine. The specificity that comes with framing these recommendations as prescriptions, Zarr says, motivates his patients to actually do them. “It’s something to look forward to and to try to feel successful about,” 
                  he says. </body>
            </div>
            <div class="column"><h3>campus health</h3>
            <br>
            <br>
            <body>In addition to mental and physical health benefits, well designed outdoor open spaces can function as thriving outdoor classrooms on college campuses. Scholl & Gulwadi (2015) write, “interaction with nature, in particular, can help to maintain or restore cognitive function such as direct attention, problem solving, focus and concentration, impulse inhibition, and memory, which can become depleted from fatigue or with overuse.” Outdoor time amongst natural elements can recharge and refocus students while providing unique stimuli and multi-sensory environments that keep them engaged. Regardless of discipline, all academic pursuits can be enhanced by a “blended” approach to classrooms that incorporate both indoor and outdoor activities, including walking seminars, outdoor seated lectures, field visits, or outdoor demonstrations of core concepts. 
            </body><br><br><body>
                Scholl & Gulwadi (2018) note that “campus planners and university educators from other disciplines may underestimate the psychological, emotional, and potential educational benefits of university campus landscapes, and their influence on how all students think and learn remains unexplored.” Campuses can build on student capacity to learn by considering outdoor spaces to be integral to their learning outcomes. With this lens, outdoor multi-purpose spaces become areas of limitless, 
                interdisciplinary potential.</body>
              <br>
              <br>
              <h5>“Not just an amalgam of paths and grass, but a space that connects  the campus in an 
                intentional way.”</h5>
              
                <br><br>
                <body>An additional component of college landscape design is campus identity, which Zach Mortice discusses in his article “Circle of Light” from Landscape Architecture Magazine. The article focuses on a redesign of a college quad by Jacobs/Ryan Associates and examines how an art installation centralized the space and generated campus-wide interest (Mortice 2019). “There was no sense as to why that quad existed. It had no purpose for being. It had no center focus,” Mortice describes, noting that before the art installation, the quad was neither integrated nor important to the rest of the campus.  Mortice stresses the significance of the corners of the quad too, stating a main purpose of the design was to create a place where the area was fully used and taken advantage of (Mortice 2019). Terry Ryan of Jacobs/Ryan achieved a diversity of uses by designing different climates throughout the space, creating personal, public, and small group pockets. 
                </body><br><br
                <body>
                    The art piece, which is central to the Jacobs/Ryan design, speaks to a greater, ongoing debate in the field of landscape architecture: preservation of campus history versus renovation and innovation. In order to assimilate into a fully developed campus, a redesign has to remain considerate of the harmonious combination of old and new spaces, it has to reach a delicate and effective balance between both. The incorporation of an art piece may break from campus tradition, but engaging art in outdoor spaces may contribute to the general health of students by cultivating a sense of community among them. It serves as a place that creates a sense of ownership, like the space was designed 
                    purposefully for them. </body>
